# Project: Super Bowl Squares

## About the Developer
- Experienced Python developer and data scientist
- New to JavaScript/web development — prefer clear explanations of JS-specific patterns
- When suggesting code, explain JS/web concepts that differ from Python (e.g., async/await, DOM manipulation, module systems, package.json vs requirements.txt)

## Tech Preferences
- Keep it simple — minimal frameworks where possible
- Explain any npm packages before adding them
- Prefer clear, readable code over clever/terse JS idioms

## Tech Constraints
- Use vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript only — no frameworks, no build tools, no npm
- Use Pico CSS (via CDN) for styling — no utility classes, just semantic HTML
- The app should work by simply opening index.html in a browser
- All code should live in the /docs folder so it can be deployed directly via GitHub Pages
- If any other third-party library is truly needed, include it via CDN script tag, not npm

## Project Goals
- Web app to generate Super Bowl squares grids
- Family use — doesn't need to be production-grade
- [Add any other specifics about features you want]
